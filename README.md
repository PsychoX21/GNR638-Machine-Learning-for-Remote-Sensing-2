This repository contains coursework, assignments, and projects for **GNR638: Machine Learning for Remote Sensing II** (Spring 2026).

## Repository Structure

### Assignment 1

**Objective**: Build a deep learning framework from scratch (C++ backend + Python frontend) without using PyTorch/TensorFlow.

- **Key Features**:
  - Custom C++ backend with CUDA acceleration.
  - Reverse-mode Automatic Differentiation (Autograd).
  - Implementation of ResNet-20 for MNIST and CIFAR-100 ($>99\%$ and $\sim70\%$ accuracy).
  - Optimized build system with `pybind11` integration.
